Overview
In a report dated July 11, 2023, Microsoft identified a phishing campaign targeting government and defense organizations in Europe and North America. The campaign operates by abusing the vulnerability CVE-2023-36884, which uses a phishing email with a malicious Word document that exploits a remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability. The lure of the phishing emails is related to the Ukranian World Congress.

Threat actor group Storm-0978, also known as RomCom, is a Russian-based cybercriminal group that's known to focus its operations on ransomware and extortion. They've also been associated with the RomCom backdoor, hence their namesake.

This group has been tracked for several years and has had successful high-profile attacks. But this lab will focus specifically on the 2023 campaign. It covers how the phishing operation works and analysis of the malicious Word document that was successfully used against diplomats at the NATO Summit.

Phishing
The attack successfully took place because one or more individuals at the NATO Summit downloaded a malicious Word document that they believed to be genuine. Similar attacks were identified by Microsoft to target telecommunications and finance sectors as well, with these being largely opportunistic.

The initial email sent to individuals at the Summit contained two links to doc files that could be downloaded, with the instructions stipulating that the recipients needed to fill in forms and read the overview sheet.

Once opened, the document contained talking points for a discussion around the Ukrainian World Congress' Ukraine In Nato campaign.

Exploit chain
There are many steps in the exploit flow. Depending on the patch status or installed version of Office, there are a number of potential steps. A researcher at Volexity released a graphic showing the full exploit chain. This is shown below.

Informative Alert
Not all artifacts are available in the public domain. As such, this lab focused on the initial infection up to the zip archive being deployed.

Document analysis
Metadata
Office documents provide a large amount of metadata that can be used to correlate attacks from threat actors across campaigns. This metadata can be helpful where elements like the name of a document or the contents change, but the computer account used to create the document remains the same. ExifTool can read these metadata entries for old and new Office documents.

Parsing Office documents
There are several methods to parse the contents of an Office document, depending on the file type. Office documents have several supported formats.

OLE: This is the legacy format for Office documents before 2017. This file type stores the elements of a document as binary objects.
XML: This newer format replaces OLE files and uses mostly XML structured data files to store the elements of documents. These XML components are all compressed using the zip format.
RTF: This format was used as a step up from plain text files; the Rich Text Format could include formatting information like bold or italics alongside the content.
HTML/XML: Office documents can also be written in web-based structures like HTML, CSS, and XML. If given a .doc the extension will open and render inside Office applications.
Several file extensions can be switched, and Office will still correctly load and determine the correct renderer.

Informative Alert
You can change the file extension of new-format Office documents to .zip and then access all the embedded files using a standard archive tool like unzip. OLE-type files require a special parser like oletools to extract the embedded objects.

Zip/XML structure
There are a few key filetypes that are found in modern Office XML formatted documents:

[Content_Types].xml – defines the content types and overrides for the document
_rels/.rels – defines relationships between objects and components
docProps/core.xml – properties relating to the document
word/document.xml – the central part of the Word document
Zip archive view of an Office document

Alongside these core components, the archive will contain all the embedded components like files, images, or other embedded objects like RTFs, macros, or documents.

Oletools
Several individual tools make up the oletools bundle. Most are designed to work on legacy formats like ole, but some tools can process other formats like zip, XML, and RTF.

Tools to analyze malicious documents
oleid – analyzes OLE files to detect specific characteristics usually found in malicious files
olevba – extracts and analyzes VBA macro source code from MS Office documents (OLE and Open XML)
MacroRaptor – detects malicious VBA Macros
msodde – detects and extracts DDE/DDEAUTO links from MS Office documents, RTF, and CSV files
pyxswf – detects, extracts, and analyzes Flash objects (SWF) that may be embedded in files such as MS Office documents and RTF files, which is especially useful for malware analysis
oleobj – extracts embedded objects from OLE files
rtfobj – extracts embedded objects from RTF files

Tools to analyze the structure of OLE files
olebrowse – a simple GUI to browse OLE files (e.g. MS Word, Excel, PowerPoint documents), allowing you to view and extract individual data streams
olemeta – extracts all standard properties (metadata) from OLE files
oletimes – extracts creation and modification timestamps of all streams and storages
oledir – displays all the directory entries of an OLE file, including free and orphaned entries
olemap – displays a map of all the sectors in an OLE file
CVE ID: CVE-2023-34362

Base score: 8.8 High

CVSS3.1: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H
